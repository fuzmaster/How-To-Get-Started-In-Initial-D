            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: center;">Why is it good?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons why Initial D is considered to be a great anime series. Here are some of the key reasons:</p>
            <ul class="why-list">
                <li><b><em>Exciting Racing Scenes:</em></b> One of the biggest draws of Initial D is its thrilling racing scenes. The series is known for its detailed depictions of cars and driving techniques, which make the races feel realistic and intense. The races are also set to a pumping Eurobeat soundtrack, which adds to the excitement and energy of the scenes.</li>
                <li><b><em>Complex Characters:</em></b> The characters in Initial D are well-developed and multi-dimensional. Takumi, the main character, goes through significant growth and development over the course of the series, and the supporting characters are also given their own story arcs and motivations. This makes the characters feel more relatable and interesting to watch.</li>
                <li><b><em>Unique Setting:</em></b> Initial D is set in the mountainous regions of Japan, which adds to the uniqueness of the series. The winding roads and steep hills create a challenging and exciting environment for the street races, and the rural setting adds to the sense of isolation and community that the characters experience.</li>
                <li><b><em>Influence on Car Culture:</em></b> Initial D has had a significant influence on car culture, not only in Japan but around the world. The series has popularized the use of drifting in racing and has inspired a new generation of car enthusiasts. Its impact on popular culture cannot be overstated.</li>
                <li><b><em>The Soundtrack:</em></b>the soundtrack of Initial D is one of the most iconic and recognizable features of the series. The music is heavily influenced by the Eurobeat genre, which originated in Europe in the 1980s and became popular in Japan in the 1990s. Eurobeat is characterized by its fast tempo, energetic beats, and synthesizer melodies.</li>
                <li>The soundtrack of Initial D includes a mix of original compositions and licensed songs from popular Eurobeat artists such as Dave Rodgers, Max Coveri, and Mega NRG Man. The music is often synchronized with the racing scenes to create a sense of excitement and intensity. Each race has its own unique soundtrack, which helps to add to the suspense and drama of the series.</li>
                <li>In addition to the Eurobeat music, the series also features other genres of music such as rock, pop, and hip-hop. The diverse range of music in the series helps to create a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere, and is one of the reasons why the soundtrack is so beloved by fans of the series.</li>
                <li>Overall, Initial D is a great anime series because of its exciting racing scenes, well-developed characters, unique setting, and influence on car culture. It's a classic series that has stood the test of time and remains popular among anime fans today.</li>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Where to begin?</h1>
            <p>As a fan of Initial D, I can say that one of the things I love about this series is that it's pretty easy to follow. Unlike other popular shows like Gundam that have different timelines and parallel stories going on, Initial D has a straight plot that progresses in a logical order. This makes it easier for newcomers to the series to get into the story and follow the events as they unfold. Whether you're a fan of cars or not, the thrilling races and intense action will keep you hooked, while the memorable characters and iconic soundtrack will leave a lasting impression.</p>
            <p>The following seasons and extra content are consider canon in the overall series and should be watched in this order to get the fullest out of the series. "Extra Stage" & Extra Stage 2 aren't needed but add more to the story that's part of what was shown in 1st stage.</p>
